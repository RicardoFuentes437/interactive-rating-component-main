## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### What I learned

i was able to reinforce my knowledge about the media queries and the different ways Javascript can help to make my page and the user interact.

### Continued development

I'll like to continue working to improve my knowledge about sass, media queries and specially responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) - This helped me understand how to use Sass variables, which made styling a lot easier.
- [Sass Mixin](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin) - Helped me understand how to use mixins, this way i donÂ´t have to write the same code snippet multiple times.
